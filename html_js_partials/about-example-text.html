What data do you safe?
I do not safe any personal identyfieable information. The only reason I ever safe IPs is to blacklist them. If you think your IP has been blacklisted by mistake, please contact me via Mail.

Do you use Cookies?
No.

Do you accept pull-requests?
Yes, however this poll's primary uniquefication is it's simplicity, if you want to implement new features you should ask me about them first - of course you can also just create your own fork it's MIT licensed!

Aren't tokens personal identifieable Information?
No they aren't. Whoever creates the poll is provided with a set of tokens. The server only tracks whereever a token is used, it has no concept of a real person that may be behind. We do not provide information about the state of a token, well, unless you try to use the token. So even for the creator it will close to impossible to know who used which token.

Who are you?
