Do you save personal identifieable information?
The only potential identifiable nformation I save, are the tokens used to track votes. Tokens are given to the creator of a poll, if I were to cooperate with the creator of the poll and the creator of the poll would keep a list of who was given which token, we would be able to match a vote to a person.

Will you ever help a poll creator match votes?
No.

Where can I report an inappropriate poll?
Send a mail to abuse@lol, be aware that this mailaddress is recieved by multiple people. If you want to contact me personally, please write to sheppy@lol.

Do you use Cookies?
I use a cookie to prevent you from voting twice in a row by accident in polls that do not require tokens.


Do you accept pull-requests?
Yes, however this poll's primary uniquefication is it's simplicity, if you want to implement new features you should ask me about them first - of course you can also just create your own fork - the project is MIT licensed!

Who are you?
